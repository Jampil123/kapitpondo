/**
 * api/lending.ts
 * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Calls the lending module of the API (M6).
 *
 * Flow: apply (member) -> check liquidity -> approve+disburse (officer) ->
 * loan active -> repayments (interest-first allocation, server-side).
 *
 * TWO CONTROL NOTES (both from the spec, both worth knowing for the panel):
 *  - approve() is APPROVE *and* DISBURSE fused into one call (approve_and_disburse_loan
 *    RPC). Spec §1.2 wanted authorization (Owner's decision) SEPARATE from
 *    disbursement (Treasurer's execution); the live API merges them and lets
 *    either treasurer or owner do both. See SPEC-DIVERGENCE in constants/roles.ts.
 *  - The server blocks an officer from approving their OWN loan; approve() will
 *    throw an ApiError in that case.
