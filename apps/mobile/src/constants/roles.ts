/**
 * constants/roles.ts
 * ============================================================================
 * The single source of truth for "which roles can do what" on the CLIENT.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: these lists mirror the API's `requireGroupRole([...])` guards as
 * they are actually enforced today — NOT the spec's §1.1 matrix. The two differ
 * in a few places (flagged with SPEC-DIVERGENCE below). UI must follow the real
 * guards so a button never appears that the API would then reject with 403.
 *
 * If/when you tighten the backend to match the spec matrix, update the lists
 * here in the same change so UI and API stay in lockstep.
 * ============================================================================
